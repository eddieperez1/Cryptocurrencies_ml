# Cryptocurrencies_ml

## Overview of Project
This project applys unsupervised machine learning clustering to a dataset about crypto currencies. The data was cleaned and transformed to numeric values so the data can be fitted to the model. Principle Component Analysis is used to reduce features then the data is scaled. Then K-Means algorithm was used to predict crypto currencies by clustering. The results were then displayed with hvplot.
